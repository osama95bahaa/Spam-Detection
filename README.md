# Spam-Detection
Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning

The project is divided into 3 parts:

- In the first part I used to read and preprocess a dataset compromised of both spam and ham emails.
- In the second part I used classifiers from sklearn to predict whether an email is ham or spam
- The third part is extracting different features and then testing using different classifiers.
